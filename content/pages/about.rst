My name is Philip Marc Schwartz, I am a Hacker. No, not the media misconception of a cyber criminal breaking into computers to steal valuable information, but a classic hacker. I am an artist of code, I am a programmer.  I am proficent in a multitude of programming languages including C, C++, Java, Perl, Python; along with many others both common and uncommon. I am an expert of systems automation with both Ansible_ and Puppet. I am also an avid photographer and a devoted husband/father.


I currently work as a Principal Developer for `T-Mobile US`__ working on the Digital Platform Development with a focus on the Enterprise Delivery Platform.

My focus is on CI/CD automation and infrastructure. This includes core development of the Jenkins based pipelines for all development teams with-in T-Mobile_.

I also have a long standing experience with Cloud computing including OpenStack development and management at scale.

I am also an active contributor to the Ansible_ project.
