My name is Philip Marc Schwartz, I am a Hacker. No, not the media misconception of a cyber criminal breaking into computers to steal valuable information, but a classic hacker. I am an artist of code, I am a programmer.  I am proficent in a multitude of programming languages including C, C++, Java, Perl, Python; along with many others both common and uncommon. I am an expert of systems automation with both Ansible_ and Puppet. I am also an avid photographer and a devoted husband/father.


I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer for `IBM Cloud US`__ working on OpenStack_ development.

My focus is primarily on OpenStack Infrastructure development, but I am also involved with Nova and Neutron development. 

I am also an active contributor to the Ansible_ project.
